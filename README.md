# Chiangs.Ninja

This is a personal portfolio project. I designed it using Figma and wrote it so that anyone who clones this project can insert their own details into the `Me Service` which will populate most of the unique details. Of course, the project and gallery will have to be updated by the new user.

Other technologies used:
- Figma UI/UX design
- Semantic UI
- SASS
- Google Maps API
- Lots and lots of CSS Grid and Flexbox

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.7.3.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.
